# Hadron Shade Theme

This is an alternate template for [hadron](https://github.com/hadronjs/hadron),
largely based off the Medium default theme and the [hadron-nodus-theme](https://github.com/hadronjs/hadron-theme-nodus) by [Mario Casciaro](https://github.com/mariocasciaro).

The banner image can be configured in the website settings page in Admin.
