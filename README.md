# Hadron Shade Theme

This is an alternate template for [hadron](https://github.com/hadronjs/hadron),
largely based off the Medium default theme and the [hadron-nodus-theme](https://github.com/hadronjs/hadron-theme-nodus) by [Mario Casciaro](https://github.com/mariocasciaro), with a configurable banner image from Hadron admin.

You view a [live demo of the theme here](http://www.johnbrett.me) or a screenshot of it below:
